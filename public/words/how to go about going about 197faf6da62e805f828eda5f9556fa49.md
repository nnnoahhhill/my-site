# how to go about going about

we have learned an incredulous amount of shit since our very first dive into the startup world
we came, we conquered, we grinded, and we know viscerally damn well we grode
we have in front of us now an intricate opportunity to really do something about that

we can take action on all we have learned, notably the alchemic nature of well bonded teams
we can operate with twofold confidence, tenfold agility and onehundredfold lack of inhibition
we can also, above all, with a value factor of dimensional complexity so grand it stands alone


literally just have an astoundingly more pleasant time at every single step of this journey


we are naturally going to do so many things different this time around, like ideally we should strive to do every single thing we ever do at minimum a teensy bit different. i do not think any of us would intend to do the same thing twice and expect different results. however, magnitudes of statistical significance worse it is to do the same thing twice and then expect the same results

we can find pleasantness at every level of this operation if we just choose to look. from our expressions of language to metaphysical postures, to our response while engulfed in the nucleus of a fire and then everything in between, small adjustments can have profound positive impacts on not just stress or camaraderie but straight up every little fiber within the well conditioned muscle that is our collective strength. the lift will be about as low as lifts come these days

we should find additional relief in that this problem requires no grind and it is neither daunting nor insurmountable. we just very simply have to make a choice. although we probably all know this, and have probably made it before, we likely havent relished in the resulting serenity to the extent we expected. this is because when complications arise, and oh man do those mf be rising, one can unintentionally sometimes forego their vigilance in enforcing that choice. the act of forgoing can be very tricky to detect and once foregone, the chance of awareness follows. situations of especial relevance can be perceived to not be so as well due to subconsciously facetious bias, or more commonly just not perceived at all. this unfortunately occurs with higher frequency than anybody would probably like to admit if they’ve the insight to know in the first place. the devil is very literally in the details and we should strive to smoke that mf out then prevent any return

we now of course have in our right hand a pretty decent idea wrapped up in a beautiful bow of aligned motivation, tagged with a hand written note that reads all the right stars are in all the right places, signed ~ the cosmos. the entire ensemble is tastefully dusted with glitter and overall looks delightful. when shaken, bells of disruption and impact and yada yada ring clear as crystal

we hold concurrently in our left hand a glimmering but less glamorous opportunity, a magic seed of enchantment eager for cultivation. a chance to not just be alive but to live vicariously in a post scarcity collective where good fucking vibes are the sole commodity that flows in abundance the likes of which we’ve never seen through every creek and crevice across all the lands. The sun shines literally every day, like even on cloudy days or days where the clouds are distinctly dark and rain falls with nefarious gusto, there is always a hole in the clouds to ensure those rays may always get precisely where they need to be. u feel good all the time, each step is lighter than last

i would without hesitation chop our right arm straight off faster than u can say “wait fuck no” if it really came down to it. this is of course no more than a figure of very dramatized speech but until we get those nuerons connected, robustly preserved, well protected and then appropriately respected, we will always feel some invisibly insidious resistance to actually making the most out of whatever delightful glittery present that mysterious old cosmos drops into our right hand next. because it will grow back and in less time than u may think. stronger too, with powerful isotopes of calcium in its bones. a lifetime of bows that need unwrapping with notes of increasing peculiarity that command reading already await us

we will be ok facing any dramatizations of similar nature. that left hand though… it is not built quite the same way. it may seem to grow back from the outside but in time will present you with nothing but undiagnosable, self perpetuating, really annoying nerve complications. this specific chance we have now, nestled in our perfectly healthy left hand, with this exact enchantment and this particular flavor of vivacity, is very, very, divinely rare. the odds of return in a case of surprise misplacement are even less favorable. even if we do happen to stumble upon similarly unique circumstance yet again, which would be not entirely unexpected, we will have to be unreactive in light of how the tingling and such is at this point now annoying the actual living fuck out of us else risk a truly unfortunate repeat fumble

when we dream about opportunity to the extent reality exists only at peak REM and reflect with satisfaction on diligent commitment to exhaustively hard work that’s constructed the very means with which we now act, we must never overlook the significance of any single card in this full set of hands weve been dealt. average lacks fully any chance of survival here, our realm of aspiration. to undervalue by blundered expectations would be followed by expense that cannot be afforded

All that i’ve really got to say is that i really think together we can crack the illusive code of doing incredibly dope shit and doing it in fantastically dope ways. we have learned tremendous amounts but most importantly weve learned the reverend mother is wrong - fear is not the mind killer at all. 

the only mind killer is bad vibes. straight up. we should aspire to take the feeling of ecstatic fright over desolate exhaustion every day of every week given the choice, no different than how one tends to be regularly. it appears now as if that choice is dangling right in front of our eyes. we cannot be promised any easier time to make it than this

with just a few slight alterations to what can be classically seen as relatively unimportant intonation, a single degree of shift in perspective here and a half degree of reflection there, an extra breath when we think its especially unneeded, the smallest of thought on occasion given to some trivial detail that disappears when viewed from more than a few inches away, and then for good measure a couple fun colors thrown in notion docs that don’t matter in the slightest

we are now just a hop, skip, and one gleeful joyous frolic away from the things that matter most. all we have dreamed and then some lies just ahead, not more than one extremely achievable distance away. lets get the fuck to it
